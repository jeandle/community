## Goals

We have written this document with several key objectives in mind:

- To ensure the long-term health and sustainability of the Jeandle community.
- To encourage new contributors to become more deeply involved and take on formal roles.
- To provide a clear path for advancement for individuals and groups who wish to grow into maintainers of this project.

## Scope

This guide covers the roles and responsibilities for everyone who contributes to the Jeandle open-source project. Whether you are writing code, improving documentation, creating tests, or helping in other ways, this document applies to you.

## General Guidelines

### Everyone is Welcome

We sincerely appreciate every contribution. You do not need a formal title to create or review pull requests (PRs), help resolve issues, or participate in discussions. Taking on a formal role is entirely voluntary, and you can contribute in any way that suits you.

### Mentorship and Guidance

As stated in our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-jdk/blob/main/jeandle-docs/contribution-guide.md), we welcome all forms of contribution, whether it's PRs, issue feedback, or ideas for new features. If you are new, we recommend starting with small, meaningful changes. These changes are easier to review and are a great way to become familiar with our processes.

As we are an open-source project, review times may vary depending on the availability of Maintainers. You can build trust and accelerate your advancement by making consistent, small-scale contributions and providing constructive feedback on the work of others.

### Sustained Contribution

If you are considering applying for one of the roles below, we hope it is because you plan to remain active in that role for the long term. If life circumstances prevent you from fulfilling your duties, it is perfectly acceptable to step back for a period. Members who are inactive for an extended time will be removed from the Jeandle GitHub organization, but you can always rejoin through the membership application process.

### Consensus for Merging

If you believe a change may be controversial, please hold off on merging to give others an opportunity to voice their opinions. Even if you have merge permissions, it does not mean you should always use them. While we want to avoid PRs being stuck indefinitely, it is equally important to ensure that everyone's perspective is heard.

### Initiating Discussions

If you are interested in advancing and taking on one of these roles, please contact a Maintainer on Slack or other community channels. We are happy to help you get started!

## Contributor Ladder

This document details the different contributor roles within our open-source project, including their responsibilities, requirements, and privileges. Contributors typically start at the first level and advance as their involvement and impact grow. We are here to support you at every step as you climb the contributor ladder!

Our ladder has two primary roles: **Committer**, **Maintainer**. Each role comes with specific responsibilities, requirements, and privileges that reflect a contributor's level of involvement and trust within the community.

Here is an overview of the roles:

| Role             | Responsibilities                                                            | Requirements                                                                   | Privileges                                                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Committer**    | Continuously participate in project maintenance.                            | A record of high-quality contributions and community trust.                    | Merge PRs, manage issues and PRs. Direct push access to repositories except the main branches     |
| **Maintainer**   | Participate in various decision-making in the community. Review various changes, ensure quality and compliance. | Extensive experience as a Committer, deep knowledge of specific project areas. | Approve PRs in repositories, nominate new Maintainers/Committers and vote for decision making.            |

*Note: As the project evolves, these roles and responsibilities may change. This document will serve as the definitive guide.*
