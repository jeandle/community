# Jeandle Project Community Meeting Guide

To promote community communication and collaboration, we hold bi-weekly community meetings organized and hosted by Maintainers. These meetings are used to synchronize progress, resolve issues, and plan for the next phase. All Jeandle contributors and anyone interested in the Jeandle project are welcome to participate.

## Meeting Schedule

- **Frequency**: Every two weeks, with specific times determined by Maintainers based on current community situation and announced in advance through issues.
- **Format**: Online meetings, which may be changed to asynchronous discussions (via email, issues, etc.) when necessary.
- **Duration**: Typically 60 minutes.
- **Records**: Meeting notes and summaries will be published in the public repository after each meeting to help non-attendees understand the content.

## Meeting Agenda (Example)

1. Current matters and progress synchronization
2. Community feedback and open discussion
3. Next phase planning and action items

## How to Participate

- Any community member (including contributors, Committers, Maintainers, etc.) may freely participate.
- If unable to attend, you can provide feedback in advance through community channels, and Maintainers will discuss it on your behalf during the meeting.
- Hosting follows a Maintainer rotation system. If the current host cannot attend, they may temporarily delegate hosting to another Maintainer or Committer.

## Additional Notes

- If you have objections to role promotions, responsibility assignments, or voting results, you may raise them during the meeting.
- Role permissions and responsibilities may be adjusted as the project evolves. Any changes require approval from the governance committee and confirmation through the voting process.
- All community members must adhere to the project's Code of Conduct. Violators may have their corresponding permissions revoked. For details, see [Jeandle Community Membership](COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md) and our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
