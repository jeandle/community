# Jeandle Project Governance

Welcome to the Jeandle project governance guide! We believe that open and transparent collaboration is the foundation for building a healthy, inclusive, and efficient community.

This repository details how the project operates, including our roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes. We are committed to keeping our procedures simple and practical, so everyone can easily understand how to participate in the project and how it works.

## Core Principles

- **Openness**: We welcome contributions of all kinds! All our communication and decision-making processes are conducted openly and transparently.
- **Inclusivity**: We are dedicated to creating a friendly and harmonious environment where people from diverse backgrounds can participate and feel a sense of belonging.
- **Neutrality**: As a community-driven project, our decisions are based on technical merit and community consensus, free from the influence of any single company or individual.
- **Simplicity**: We strive to keep our governance processes as straightforward as possible, avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy.
