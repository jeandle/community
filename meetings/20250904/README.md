  #### Main Discussion Points from Q&A Session

  **Q: What should we pay attention to regarding code contribution process and copyright?**
  A:
  - Must understand and sign CLA and related agreements, while strictly paying attention to copyright issues of imported code
  - Maintain code quality and follow project development standards
  - Understand common open source licenses and clarify the differences between them

  **Q: Are there clear community governance rules?**
  A: We have established a complete community governance. Community governance has been a key consideration from the project's inception, and we launched the [community repository](https://github.com/jeandle/community) alongside the main jeandle repository, containing detailed community governance rules.

  We are committed to keeping community interactions simple and transparent, with all content related to community collaboration, feature direction setting, and specific progress being public and traceable.

  **Q: Is the roadmap clear, and how about SpecJBB performance benchmarks?**
  A: The roadmap is detailed in the meeting presentation (in the attachments section). This year we focus on feature implementation, with performance optimization not being a priority for now.

  **Q: Which version of JDK is currently supported? What's the upgrade and compatibility strategy going forward?**
  A: Currently developing based on JDK 21. Migration to higher JDK versions will be considered after the project reaches a stable state.

  **Q: What technical problems does the jeandle project solve?**
  A: The main goal is to improve Java application performance while fully leveraging the advantages of the LLVM ecosystem to drive project development.

  **Q: What are the roles and responsibilities of different community roles?**
  A:
  - Multiple companies and teams have confirmed their intention to collaborate and jointly advance the project
  - Welcome all developers interested in the project to participate and contribute
  - Clear division of responsibilities: contact @mingcheng for community affairs, contact @taofengliu for development and technical details
