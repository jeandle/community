This document outlines the responsibilities of different contributor roles within the Jeandle community.

For detailed information on community member roles, responsibilities, and eligibility requirements, please refer to our [Contributor Ladder](CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md).

## Decision-Making Process

Jeandle is an open source project committed to transparent operations. Our code repositories are the single source of truth for everything — our values, designs, documentation, roadmap, and interfaces.

In short, any change affecting Jeandle, large or small, follows these simple steps:

- **Step 1**: Propose a change or raise a concern by creating an issue in this repository.
- **Step 2**: Discuss the issue in the comments.
- **Step 3**: Resolve the issue two weeks after its creation based on community consensus.

All decisions, except member nominations, must receive approval from at least two-thirds (rounded up) of the voters to be passed. For all decisions, only maintainers have voting rights.

## Membership Management

Our members share the responsibility for the project's success. Collectively, they:

- Are responsible for the project's outcomes.
- Are committed to the long-term improvement of the project.
- Dedicate time to all necessary tasks, not just the interesting ones.

Members often work hard behind the scenes, and their efforts are not always visible. While it's easy to get excited about new features, it is equally important—and often more challenging—to handle bug fixes, minor improvements, stability optimizations, and all the other foundational work that keeps the project robust.

### Adding New Committers/Maintainers

Committers/Maintainers are contributors committed to the long-term success of the project. If you aspire to become a Committer/Maintainer, you should be actively involved in resolving issues, contributing code, and reviewing proposals and pull requests for at least tree months.

Membership is built on trust, which is about more than just writing code. You need to earn the trust of existing Committers/Maintainers by consistently acting in the best interests of the project.

New Committers/Maintainers are nominated by existing Committers/Maintainers and require a vote from existing Maintainers for approval. Each resolution for the appointment of a Committer is considered approved if no opposing votes are received. Each resolution for the appointment of a Maintainer must receive approval from at least two-thirds (rounded up) of the voters.

### Removing Inactive Committers/Maintainers

If an existing Committer/Maintainer no longer meets the role's expectations, they can be removed from the list. Any other Maintainer can propose their removal via a pull request if the member meets either of the following criteria:

- They have not participated in community activities for over three months.
- They have violated governance rules more than twice.

Once the conditions are confirmed, the Committer/Maintainer can be removed.

### Voluntary Resignation

If a member wishes to voluntarily step down from their position, they can notify the community of their resignation at any time by creating an issue in the community repository. In this case:

1.  **Create a Resignation Notice**
    * Post an issue in the community repository.
    * Provide at least 7 days' notice before the last working day.
    * Clearly state the specific resignation date.
2.  **Provide Handover Details**
    * Share handover information.
    * Explain any ongoing responsibilities.

The resignation will be publicly announced and remain visible for at least 7 days. During this period:

- No formal vote is required.
- The resigning member should include any relevant handover information in the notice.
- Other members should acknowledge the resignation with a message of thanks.

## Maximum Representation Limit

To ensure balanced representation, no more than four Maintainers may be from the same company or organization.
