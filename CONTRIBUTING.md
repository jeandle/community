Welcome to the Jeandle community! We are excited about your interest in contributing and appreciate your enthusiasm and effort. This guide will help you get started.

We value every contribution, from fixing a typo to implementing a new feature. To ensure a smooth and collaborative process, please read this guide carefully.

## Code of Conduct

First and foremost, we expect all contributors to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please make sure you are familiar with its contents to help us maintain a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

If you are new to the project, here are some ways you can contribute:

- **Browse open issues**: Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are great starting points for new contributors.
- **Improve documentation**: We always appreciate help in making our documentation clearer and more comprehensive.
- **Participate in discussions**: Join discussions in issues and pull requests to share your insights and help others.

Before you start working on an issue, please leave a comment to let others know you are on it. If you plan to work on something that doesn't have an issue, please [create one](https.github.com/jeandle/community/issues/new/choose) first to discuss the proposed changes.

## Development Workflow

To contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository**: Create your own fork of the repository you wish to contribute to.
2.  **Clone your fork**: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git`
3.  **Create a new branch**: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
4.  **Make your changes**: Write your code and add or update tests as needed.
5.  **Commit your changes**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
6.  **Push to your branch**: `git push origin my-feature-branch`
7.  **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository.

## Pull Request Guidelines

To help us review your pull request efficiently, please ensure the following:

- **Clear Title and Description**: The PR title should be concise, and the description should provide enough context about the changes. Link to any relevant issues.
- **Tests**: Include tests that cover your changes.
- **Passing CI**: Make sure all continuous integration checks are passing.

Once your PR is submitted, a maintainer will review it. The review process is guided by our [governance policies](GOVERNANCE.md) and [membership roles](COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md). Be prepared to address feedback and make further changes.

## Security Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** report it through public GitHub issues. Instead, follow the instructions in our [Security Reporting Guide](SECURITY.md).

## Community

We encourage you to get involved with the community. For more details on our community structure and how to advance, please see our [Contributor Ladder](CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md).

Thank you for your contribution!
